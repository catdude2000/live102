### **Learning markdowns**

_They're really ~~not~~ fun._

Today we learned about using the growth mindset to learn, and used that mindset to learn about markdowns.
Growth mindset is a way of thinking that allows one to develop skills beyond their inherent natural abilities.
As opposed to a fixed mindset which is a belief that one can't progress beyond their natural strengths and talents, a growth mindset allows one to expand on one's existing talents.  This is a more flexible way of learning that expands one's way of thinking rather than just memorizing facts.

Markdown is a language used for markups, which is using plain style text to create stylized and formated content.  Using symbols and text, markdown lets one design a web page the way one wants.  It is however required that the correct symbols and text be in exactly the correct places for one's page to look and function properly.  If your not careful, you may have links that lead nowhere or have text overlooked.

In the words of Yoda
